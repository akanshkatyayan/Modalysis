### Bart Summarization:
> Summarization strategies are typically categorized as extractive, abstractive or mixed. 
>  - Extractive strategies select the top N sentences that best represent the key points of the article. 
>  - Abstractive summaries seek to reproduce the key points of the article in new words.
>  
> Extractive summarization is a challenging NLP task that has only recently become practical by transformer models like BART. It is a denoising autoencoder for pretraining sequence-to-sequence models. BART is trained by 
>  - (1) corrupting text with an arbitrary noising function, and 
>  - (2) learning a model to reconstruct the original text. 
>  
>  It uses a standard Tranformer-based neural machine translation architecture which, despite its simplicity, can be seen as generalizing BERT (due to the bidirectional encoder), GPT (with the left-to-right decoder), and many other more recent pretraining schemes. Bart uses a standard seq2seq/machine translation architecture with a bidirectional encoder (like BERT) and a left-to-right decoder (like GPT)

## Setup: Local Deployment
```
git clone https://github.com/antra0497/Modalysis.git
cd Modalysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the Flask server
```
python wsgi.py
```
## Setup: GCP Deployment

Google App Engine (often referred to as GAE or simply App Engine) is a cloud computing platform as a service for developing and hosting web applications in Google-managed data centers. Applications are sandboxed and run across multiple servers. It offers automatic scaling for web applicationsâ€”as the number of requests increases for an application and automatically allocates more resources for the web application to handle the additional demand.


**Steps:**
 - Created a VM instance on Google cloud Platfom
 - Created a Project named: Modalysis
 - Enable Cloud Engine API
 - App Engine:
    -  Create a new application
    -  Select location : europe-west2
 -  Source repository:
    -  Add repo: connect external repo
    -  Authenticate from github repo
    -  Changed the gcloud config for timeout :  ```gcloud config set app/cloud_build_timeout 5000```
    -  Deployed App: ```gcloud app deploy```
